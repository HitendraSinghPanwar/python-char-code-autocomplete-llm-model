# python-char-code-autocomplete-llm-model
A lightweight character-level Python code autocompletion system built with a GRU-based recurrent neural network, trained on the CoNaLa dataset. Given a Python prompt, the model performs autoregressive next-character prediction to generate code completions. Optimized for fast inference and easy deployment via a FastAPI web interface.
